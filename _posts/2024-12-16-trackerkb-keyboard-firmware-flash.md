There are two main hosts for the M8 Headless:
- [M8WebDisplay](https://derkyjadex.github.io/M8WebDisplay/): Runs in a browser without any app installation
- [M8C](https://github.com/laamaa/m8c): Cross-platform M8 tracker headless client that runs as an application


The default keyboard firmware that comes with the TrackerKB is for the `M8 Web Display`. If you want to use `M8C` as your main host, this guide will show you how to flash new firmware onto the onboard Raspberry Pi Pico.

### Key Mapping Differences Between Two Hosts  

| Key Function | M8C Mapping | M8 Web Display Mapping |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Up Arrow     | Key Up      | Key UP                 |
| Down Arrow   | Key Down    | Key Down               |
| Left Arrow   | Key Left    | Key Left               |
| Right Arrow  | Key Right   | Key Right              |
| Option       | a           | z                      |
| Edit         | s           | x                      |
| Shift        | Left Shift  | Left Shift             |
| Play         | Space-bar   | Space-bar              |

# Steps for Flashing Keyboard Firmware

## Step 1: Unscrew the Enclosure
Use the `H2.5 Hex Screwdriver` to unscrew the four screws on the enclosure.

## Step 2: Access Raspberry Pi Pico's Loader Mode
1. Use the paperclip to short the boot pins and **hold it**.

2. Connect the USB Cable to the PC.
3. Release the boot pin (paperclip) shortly after connecting the USB cable.

A new disk drive should now be mounted.

## Step 3: Drag and Drop the Firmware to the Disk
Simply **drag and drop** the new firmware file to the mounted disk. The drive will then unmount itself and the device will boot with the new firmware.
