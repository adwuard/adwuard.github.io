### Problem
Iâ€™ve been searching for a lightweight and simple release plate for my Leica M11. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any release plate that met my requirements.
The main issues with most plates on the market are:
- They are too big and heavy, often including a grip that adds extra weight.
- They block the battery release switch on the M11/M11-P.

So, I decided to take on the joy of designing a custom release plate for the M11 myself. My goal was to create the thinnest and lightest release plate that can stay on the camera.

### Solution
The custom plate I designed is ultra-light and low profile, making it 50% thinner than standard Arca-Swiss plates and weighing only about 15g. It includes a precise opening for the battery release switch, allowing for easy removal of the battery and SD card without needing to detach the plate. This design aims to provide a perfect balance between convenient tripod use and minimal setup during everyday photography.

### The Design

The plate works great and feels excellent for staying on the camera. It also protects the Leica M11-P's bottom plate.

### Too Much to Spare ðŸ˜…
Thanks to CNC MOQs, I now have a surplus of custom release plates. Who knew one design would lead to so many extras?
