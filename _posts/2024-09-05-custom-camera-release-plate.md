## Designing a Custom Arca-Swiss Release Plate for Leica M11/P

### Problem
Iâ€™ve been searching for a lightweight and simple release plate for my Leica M11. The main issues are:
- Most plates on the market are too big and heavy, often coming with an unnecessary grip.
- They block the battery release switch on the M11.

So, I decided to take on the challenge of designing a custom release plate for the M11 myself. My goal was to create the thinnest and lightest release plate that can stay on the camera.

### Solution
The custom plate I designed is ultra-light and low profile, making it 50% thinner than standard Arca-Swiss plates and weighing only about 15g. It includes a precise opening for the battery release switch, allowing for easy removal of the battery and SD card without needing to detach the plate. This design aims to provide a perfect balance between convenient tripod use and minimal setup during everyday photography.

### The Design

The plate works great and feels excellent for staying on the camera. It also protects the bottom plate.

### Too Much for Spare
