## Designing a Custom Arca-Swiss Release Plate for Leica M11/P

### Problem
I’ve been searching for a lightweight and simple release plate for my Leica M11. The main issues are:
- Most plates on the market are too big and heavy, often coming with an unnecessary grip.
- They block the battery release switch on the M11.

So, I decided to take on the challenge of designing a custom release plate for the M11 myself. My goal was to create the thinnest and lightest release plate that can stay on the camera.

### Solution
The plate I designed is ultra-light and low profile. It’s 50% thinner than common Arca-Swiss plates, weighing approximately 15g. Additionally, it features an opening for the battery release switch. I hope this design strikes a good balance between tripod use and minimal day-to-day use.

### The Design

The plate works great and feels excellent for staying on the camera. It also protects the bottom plate.

### Too Much for Spare
