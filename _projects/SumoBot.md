# Overview
Sumo Robot Build: An sumo robot project that combined robotics with strategic algorithm, and improved PID control method, resulting in a first-place win at a prestigious engineering conference.

- Key Features:
    - Implementation of fuzzy logic algorithms in Arduino for nuanced decision-making
    - Optimized torque for a perfect balance between power and control, with PID speed and acceleration control
    - Maximized traction for stability and maneuverability in the sumo ring
- Achievements:
    - First place at the [**ASME Pacific Northwest Engineering Student Design Conference**](https://www.shorelineareanews.com/2016/05/shoreline-students-win-big-at-asme.html)
