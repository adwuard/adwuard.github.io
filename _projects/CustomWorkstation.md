# Overview
Creating a powerful workstation is a dream for many developers and engineers. My objective is to design a PC case that fulfills my specific requirements.

## Requirements
- **Powerful Hardware**: The Intel NUC 13 Extreme with an i9-13900K, Nvidia 3090TI 24GB, and 64GB DDR5 is a powerhouse that meets my daily demands:
  - **AI Projects**: Efficiently trains and runs AI models.
  - **Chromium OS Development**: The i9's 5.60GHz 24 cores drastically reduce build times from 8 hours on my old machine to just 1-2 hours.
  - **Image Rendering with Blender**: Easily handles complex rendering tasks.
  - **3D CAD and PCB Designs**: Provides the necessary GPU and CPU power for detailed 3D and PCB designs.
- **Compact Size**: The NUC Extreme 13 features an impressive design, making the motherboard smaller than a standard m-ITX board while offering excellent thermal cooling.
- **Portability**: Equipped with a handle for easy transport.
- **Integrated Monitor**: Includes a built-in 3:2 aspect-ratio screen with a tilting mechanism. The 3:2 aspect ratio is ideal for programming, and there are few 3:2 screen laptops available. Adding a 3:2 screen makes my dream come true!
- **Protective Case and Durable Design**: Ensures the workstation is well-protected for transportation.
