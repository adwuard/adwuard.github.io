With 5 years of expertise in product engineering and development processes, I've helped Vibe Inc. deliver over 10 complex smart products from concept to mass production.

I possess multidisciplinary knowledge in software development, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, with hands-on experience solving challenging cross-domain problems. I enjoy building quality products that not only feel good in hand but also empower imaginations.

# My Professional Projects
At [Vibe Inc.](https://vibe.us/), my mission is to build creative and innovative products that empower remote collaboration. I'm focused on developing products like 55"/75" Smart Whiteboards and AI Cameras, These tools are incredibly useful for both business meetings and educational settings, enhancing connectivity and idea-sharing across any distance.

Part of my job is taking product ideas from scratch and turning them into real products. It's a hands-on experience where I get to dive into both product design and prototyping. This means tackling a bunch of different challenges across various fields, which keeps things exciting and fresh.

# Vibe OS (Chromium OS)

<img src="images/about/chromiumos.png" height="85" />

At Vibe, we build our operating system on Google's ChromiumOS. It offers the excellent sandboxing security that Chromium is well known for. We manage a distribution optimized for a whiteboarding experience called Vibe OS. Our hardware is deeply integrated into the system, providing a seamless experience between the OS and hardware.

An example of my work is on the CRAS audio service, integrating AI-powered speech and video enhancements, elevating conference meeting experiences.

### Contributions:
- OS development and Kernel BSPs.
- ChromiumOS CRAS/ALSA: Experience in full-stack audio pipeline development and debugging, providing low-latency audio/video features.
- Camera stack and video processing pipeline development.
- Built full-stack OTA update and enterprise policy management services.
